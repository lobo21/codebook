This dataset contains partial results of the experimental research called "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set ", conduced by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio and Luca Oneto in Smartlab-Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, Universit√  degli Studi di Genova, Italy.

As informed by the authors, the research have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers with 19-48 years old. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing and laying) wearing a smartphone Samsung Galaxy SII on the waist. Reyes-Ortiz, Anguita, Ghio and Oneto (2012) describes other technical details of the experiments.

The first variable is "Subject", i.e., the participants of the research. The second variable is "Activit", composed by six nominal values: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS
", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING" and "LAYING
".

The names of the variables related to the measures produced by the experiment are structured in the following sequence of five parts:

(1)   "t" or "f": "t" express "time domain signal"; "f" means the mathematic procedure called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), that was applied to the time signals;
(2)   "Body" or "Gravity": body or gravity acceleration signals;
(3.1) "Acc" or "Gyro": raw data colected by the two types of smartphone sensor, accelerometer or gyroscope, each one collecting 3-axial raw signals (axis "X", "Y" and "Z");
(3.2) "Jerk": express "Jerk signals", or the time derivative of acceleration, which plays an important role in vibration control. "Jerk" is the time rate of change of acceleration, or the acceleration of the acceleration. This procedure was applied in the options in 3.1;
(4)   "X", "Y" or "Z": the three directional axis of the sensors; and
(5)   "mean" or "std": the mean or standard deviation calculated for the combinations of items above.

The complete list of the variables is: "Subject","Activity","tBodyAcc.mean.X","tBodyAcc.mean.Y","tBodyAcc.mean.Z","tBodyAcc.std.X","tBodyAcc.std.Y","tBodyAcc.std.Z","tGravityAcc.mean.X","tGravityAcc.mean.Y","tGravityAcc.mean.Z","tGravityAcc.std.X","tGravityAcc.std.Y","tGravityAcc.std.Z","tBodyAccJerk.mean.X","tBodyAccJerk.mean.Y","tBodyAccJerk.mean.Z","tBodyAccJerk.std.X","tBodyAccJerk.std.Y","tBodyAccJerk.std.Z","tBodyGyro.mean.X","tBodyGyro.mean.Y","tBodyGyro.mean.Z","tBodyGyro.std.X","tBodyGyro.std.Y","tBodyGyro.std.Z","tBodyGyroJerk.mean.X","tBodyGyroJerk.mean.Y","tBodyGyroJerk.mean.Z","tBodyGyroJerk.std.X","tBodyGyroJerk.std.Y","tBodyGyroJerk.std.Z","tBodyAccMag.mean","tBodyAccMag.std","tGravityAccMag.mean","tGravityAccMag.std","tBodyAccJerkMag.mean","tBodyAccJerkMag.std","tBodyGyroMag.mean","tBodyGyroMag.std","tBodyGyroJerkMag.mean","tBodyGyroJerkMag.std","fBodyAcc.mean.X","fBodyAcc.mean.Y","fBodyAcc.mean.Z","fBodyAcc.std.X","fBodyAcc.std.Y","fBodyAcc.std.Z","fBodyAcc.meanFreq.X","fBodyAcc.meanFreq.Y","fBodyAcc.meanFreq.Z","fBodyAccJerk.mean.X","fBodyAccJerk.mean.Y","fBodyAccJerk.mean.Z","fBodyAccJerk.std.X","fBodyAccJerk.std.Y","fBodyAccJerk.std.Z","fBodyAccJerk.meanFreq.X","fBodyAccJerk.meanFreq.Y","fBodyAccJerk.meanFreq.Z","fBodyGyro.mean.X","fBodyGyro.mean.Y","fBodyGyro.mean.Z","fBodyGyro.std.X","fBodyGyro.std.Y","fBodyGyro.std.Z","fBodyGyro.meanFreq.X","fBodyGyro.meanFreq.Y","fBodyGyro.meanFreq.Z","fBodyAccMag.mean","fBodyAccMag.std","fBodyAccMag.meanFreq","fBodyBodyAccJerkMag.mean","fBodyBodyAccJerkMag.std","fBodyBodyAccJerkMag.meanFreq","fBodyBodyGyroMag.mean","fBodyBodyGyroMag.std","fBodyBodyGyroMag.meanFreq","fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag.mean","fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag.std","fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag.meanFreq".

For example, the variable "tBodyAcc.mean.X" means the time domain signal obtained by body acceleration signals in the X-axis; the variable "tBodyGyroJerk.std.Z" represents the standard deviation of the time domain signal obtained by the gyroscope measuring body acceleration signals in the Z-axis.
